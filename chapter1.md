One day Melvin a very handsome mermaid decided he wanted a pet.  
This was a problem as fish were friends, they could not be pets.  
Since Melvin could talk to animals, one of the perks of being half fish himself Melvin needed to find an animal that didn't talk.  
Sitting on the beach Melvin saw a worm and said "Hello."
No response.
Had Melvin found his new pet?
